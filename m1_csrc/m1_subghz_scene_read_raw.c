 * @file   m1_subghz_scene_read_raw.c
 * @brief  Sub-GHz Read Raw Scene — raw RF capture with RSSI waveform.
 *
 * Momentum-aligned state machine and button layout.
 *
 * States: START (passive listen, radio on) → RECORDING (SD file open, TIM1 armed)
 *         → IDLE (capture on SD) → TX (async TX, non-blocking)
 *         START is also re-entered after Erase.
 *         LOADED (pre-existing file from Saved browser) → LoadKeyTX (async TX)
 *
 * On fresh entry the scene enters START state with the radio in passive listen.
 * Pressing OK begins recording (opens the SD file, arms TIM1 ISR).
 * Pressing OK again stops recording and enters IDLE (Erase/Send/Save).
 * If recording init fails (OOM or SD error) the scene stays in START so
 * the user can configure and retry.
 *
 * Button mapping (matches physical D-pad left/OK/right):
 *   START:     LEFT = Config  |  OK = ⊙ REC  |  RIGHT = (none)
 *   RECORDING: (none)         |  OK = ⊙ Stop  |  (none)
 *   IDLE:      LEFT = Erase   |  OK = ⊙ Send  |  RIGHT = Save
 *   LOADED:    LEFT = New     |  OK = ⊙ Send  |  RIGHT = More
 *   TX / LoadKeyTX: (none)    |  (none)        |  (none)   [async TX; BACK aborts]
 *
 *   BACK = Exit (START/IDLE/LOADED) or Stop recording (RECORDING → IDLE)
 *          or Abort TX and return to Idle/Loaded (TX states).
 *
 * Display:
 *   START:     RSSI spectrogram.  Cursor does NOT advance in this state — the live
 *              RSSI level is shown at the current (frozen) cursor position so the
 *              user can judge signal strength before pressing OK to start recording.
 *              This makes the visual distinction unambiguous: a filling/scrolling
 *              waveform always means RECORDING is in progress (button = "Stop").
 *   RECORDING: Cursor advancement is driven entirely by the 200ms draw tick —
 *              NOT by SubGhzEventRxData.  On each tick, RSSI is sampled:
 *              above threshold → push_ext(rssi, true) advances the cursor;
 *              below threshold → push_ext(rssi, false) freezes the cursor
 *              immediately.  This is Momentum's tick-only pattern — cursor
 *              ownership belongs to the draw tick, not to incoming edge events.
 *   IDLE:      Spectrogram frozen; "X spl." sample count, filename in waveform area.
 *              LEFT = Erase, ⊙ OK = Send (replay), RIGHT = Save (rename via VKB).
 *   LOADED:    Spectrogram reset (empty); "RAW" status, filename in waveform area.
 *              LEFT = New (discard loaded file, start fresh), ⊙ OK = Send (replay),
 *              RIGHT = More → MoreRAW submenu (Decode / Rename / Delete).
 *              This is Momentum's LoadKeyIDLE + MoreRAW pattern — entered when a
 *              pre-recorded RAW file is opened from the Saved browser OR when the
 *              user renames a freshly recorded file (IDLE → Loaded after Save).
 *   TX / LoadKeyTX: Spectrogram replaced by an animated sine wave inside
 *              the waveform box (Momentum-style live-TX indicator); no
 *              button bar.  Entered from either IDLE (→ TX) or LOADED
 *              (→ LoadKeyTX).  TX runs asynchronously: the DMA TC ISR posts
 *              Q_EVENT_SUBGHZ_TX which is delivered here as
 *              SubGhzEventTxComplete.  Hold-to-repeat: if the OK button is
 *              still held when a burst completes, the scene transitions
 *              TX → TXRepeat (or LoadKeyTX → LoadKeyTXRepeat) and the
 *              async driver auto-rearms.  Releasing OK returns to
 *              IDLE/LOADED.  BACK aborts the in-flight TX synchronously
 *              and returns to the originating state (TX/TXRepeat → IDLE,
 *              LoadKeyTX/LoadKeyTXRepeat → LOADED).
 *
 *   scene_on_enter → START state (passive listen, radio on, no file open).
 *   OK → RECORDING (opens SD file, arms TIM1 ISR).
 *   OK → IDLE (Erase / Send / Save).
 *   scene_on_exit → radio fully stopped.
 *
 * Recording data path:
 *   ISR → ring buffer → sub_ghz_rx_raw_save() → SD card (.sub file)
 *   Data is streamed to SD during recording.  After stop the file exists
 *   on SD and can be replayed (Send) or renamed (Save).
 *   The saved file is Flipper-compatible (RAW_Data: signed integers).
