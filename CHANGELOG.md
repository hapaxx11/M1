# Changelog

All notable changes to the M1 project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0.0-Hapax.9] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **CI: Manual build-and-release workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`):
  `workflow_dispatch`-only GitHub Actions workflow that installs the ARM GCC toolchain,
  builds the firmware with CMake + Ninja, injects CRC32 + Hapax metadata via
  `append_crc32.py`, and publishes a GitHub Release with `.elf`, `.hex`, raw `.bin`, and
  `_wCRC.bin` artifacts. Tag and release title are auto-derived from source versions but
  can be overridden as inputs.

- **Music Player** (`Games` menu): plays Flipper Music Format (`.fmf`) files from
  `SD:/Music/`. Full FMF parser (BPM, Duration, Octave, Notes), buzzer-based playback
  with progress bar and per-note display. BACK button aborts playback.
- **Field Detect** (`NFC` menu): passive NFC (13.56 MHz) and LF-RFID (125 kHz) field
  detector. Displays real-time bar indicators for both technologies and beeps on first
  detection. Powered by `m1_field_detect.c`.
- **Signal Generator** (`GPIO` menu): continuous square-wave output via the buzzer timer.
  18 frequency presets from 200 Hz to 8 kHz; UP/DOWN to change frequency, OK to
  toggle on/off. Implemented in `signal_gen.c`.
- **Buzzer continuous-tone API**: `m1_buzzer_tone_start(freq)` and `m1_buzzer_tone_stop()`
  — start/stop a tone without an auto-stop timer, used by Music Player and Signal Gen.

### Changed

- Documentation governance: added "Documentation Update Rules" to `CLAUDE.md` and expanded
  `.github/GUIDELINES.md` with project-specific CHANGELOG format guidance; all future agent
  sessions are required to update `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and
  `documentation/flipper_import_agent.md` as part of every change

- Documentation: expanded `HARDWARE.md` with MCU specs, RAM, speed, and peripheral table;
  added secondary-reference note in `CLAUDE.md` pointing to new hardware schematics doc

### Added

- `documentation/hardware_schematics.md`: schematic-derived hardware reference covering ICs,
  power subsystem, RF subsystems, interface signals, and a capability assessment table mapping
  hardware evidence to firmware support status — intended as a secondary reference for AI
  agents determining potential device support beyond what official firmware exposes

**Flipper Zero Compatibility**
- Import and use Flipper Zero `.sub`, `.rfid`, `.nfc`, and `.ir` files directly from SD card
- Generic Flipper key-value file parser (`flipper_file.c`)

**Sub-GHz**
- 73 protocol decoders (up from stock): Princeton, CAME, Nice Flo, Keeloq, Security+ 1.0/2.0,
  Linear, Holtek, Hormann, Marantec, Somfy, Ansonic, BETT, Clemsa, Doitrand, Dickert, FireFly,
  CAME Twee/Atomo, Nice Flor S, Alutech AT-4N, Centurion, Kinggates Stylo, Megacode,
  Mastercode, Chamberlain 7/8/9-bit, Liftmaster 10-bit, Dooya, Honeywell, Intertechno, Elro,
  Acurite, Ambient Weather, Bresser 3ch/5in1/6in1, TFA Dostmann, Nexus-TH, ThermoPro TX-2,
  GT-WT03, Oregon v2, LaCrosse, Infactory, Scher-Khan Magicar/Logicar, Toyota, and all
  remaining Flipper gap protocols (17 newly added to reach 73 total)

- Record screen shows "Recording..." during capture, clears on stop
- Record complete screen shows "Recording complete" with Play/Reset/Save
- Transmit screen shows "Transmitting..." with OK to replay

**LF-RFID**
- 20+ protocol decoders: HID Generic, Indala, AWID, Pyramid, Paradox, IOProx, FDX-A/B,
  Viking, Electra, Gallagher, Jablotron, PAC/Stanley, G-Prox II, Keri, Nexwatch, Noralsy,
  Securakey, IDTECK, HID Extended, EM4100, H10301, and more
- Clone Card — write to T5577 tags
- Erase Tag — reset T5577 to factory defaults
- T5577 Info — read tag configuration block
- RFID Fuzzer — protocol testing tool
- Manchester decoder with carrier auto-detection (ASK/PSK)

**NFC**
- Tag Info — manufacturer lookup, SAK decode, technology identification
- T2T Page Dump — read and display Type 2 Tag memory pages
- Clone & Emulate — copy and replay NFC tags
- NFC Fuzzer — protocol testing tool
- MIFARE Classic Crypto1 support

**Infrared**
- Universal Remote Database — pre-built remotes for Samsung, LG, Sony, Vizio, Bose, Denon,
  and more (see `ir_database/`)
- Learn & Save — record IR signals and save to SD card
- Import Flipper Zero `.ir` files
- New database files use "IR library file" header matching Flipper format

**BadUSB**
- DuckyScript interpreter — run keystroke injection scripts from SD card
- Supports `STRING`, `DELAY`, `GUI`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `SHIFT`, key combos, and `REPEAT`
- Place `.txt` scripts in `BadUSB/` on the SD card

**Bad-BT (Bluetooth)**
- Wireless DuckyScript — same scripting as BadUSB but over Bluetooth HID

**WiFi**
- Scan — discover nearby access points
- Connect — join networks with password entry
- Saved Networks — manage stored WiFi credentials
- Status — view connection state, IP address, signal strength

**Bluetooth Device Manager**
- Scan, save, and manage BLE devices

**Dual Boot**
- Two firmware banks with CRC validation before boot
- Swap banks from menu or companion app; falls back to working bank on corruption
- DFU boot mode: hold Up+OK at power-on to enter STM32 ROM USB DFU bootloader

**RPC / Companion App**
- RPC protocol for [qMonstatek](https://github.com/bedge117/qMonstatek) desktop companion app
- Device info, firmware flash over USB, screen mirror, SD card browsing, WiFi management,
  ESP32 firmware update; `hapax_revision` field distinguishes Hapax builds from stock

**System / Stability**
- FreeRTOS heap increased from 120 KB to 256 KB
- Settings persistence — LCD brightness, southpaw mode, and preferences saved to SD card
- Southpaw mode — swap left/right button functions
- Safe NMI handler — proper ECC double-fault recovery with protected flash read helper
- Watchdog suspend/resume around long operations (flash, UART, firmware update)
- ESP32 serial flasher: MD5 verification, RX flush before retries, watchdog reset during TX
- Post-build CRC + Hapax metadata injection via `tools/append_crc32.py` (`--c3-revision`)

### Fixed

- Crash on RFID read caused by rogue `pulse_handler` call in `TIM1_CC` ISR
