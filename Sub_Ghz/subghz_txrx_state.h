 * @file   subghz_txrx_state.h
 * @brief  Sub-GHz radio lifecycle state machine — pure logic, host-testable.
 *
 * Models the SI4463 radio lifecycle as an explicit state machine so that
 * legal transitions can be enforced at the scene/wrapper layer instead of
 * relying on scattered discipline rules (see CLAUDE.md "SI4463 Radio State
 * Management").
 *
 * This module is hardware-independent: it does NOT touch the SI4463, TIM1,
 * DMA, or any HAL.  Hardware-coupled wrappers (introduced in later commits)
 * call into this state machine to validate transitions and report current
 * state.  This separation makes the lifecycle logic unit-testable on the
 * host and removes a long-standing class of "radio works in tool X but not
 * in tool Y" bugs documented in CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * States:
 *   OFF       — Radio powered off (after menu_sub_ghz_exit, after init failure)
 *   IDLE      — Radio powered on but neither receiving nor transmitting
 *   RX_PASSIVE— Receiving for live RSSI only; TIM1 input-capture NOT armed
 *   RX_ACTIVE — Receiving with TIM1 IC armed; edges flow to ring buffer
 *   TX_BLOCK  — Blocking TX in progress (legacy wrappers)
 *   TX_ASYNC  — Async TX in progress (DMA TC posts Q_EVENT_SUBGHZ_TX)
 *
 * Legal transitions form this graph (any transition not listed is rejected):
 *
 *   OFF        → IDLE                      (power on)
 *   IDLE       → OFF                       (power off)
 *   IDLE       → RX_PASSIVE                (start passive RX)
 *   IDLE       → RX_ACTIVE                 (start full RX)
 *   IDLE       → TX_BLOCK                  (start blocking replay)
 *   IDLE       → TX_ASYNC                  (sub_ghz_replay_start_async)
 *   RX_PASSIVE → IDLE                      (stop)
 *   RX_PASSIVE → RX_ACTIVE                 (arm IC for capture)
 *   RX_PASSIVE → OFF                       (full deinit)
 *   RX_ACTIVE  → RX_PASSIVE                (pause IC, keep radio in RX)
 *   RX_ACTIVE  → IDLE                      (stop)
 *   RX_ACTIVE  → OFF                       (full deinit)
 *   TX_BLOCK   → OFF                       (legacy wrappers exit with radio off)
 *   TX_BLOCK   → IDLE                      (after menu_sub_ghz_init restore)
 *   TX_ASYNC   → IDLE                      (continue_async DONE/ERROR or abort)
 *   TX_ASYNC   → RX_PASSIVE                (scene resumes listen after TX)
 *
 * The state machine intentionally does NOT model:
 *   - Frequency / modulation changes (orthogonal to lifecycle)
 *   - Hopper state (handled by a separate timer in scenes)
 *   - TX repeat counting (encoder-internal)
